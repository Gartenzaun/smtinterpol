  abstract	= {Craig interpolation in SMT is difficult because theory
		  combination and integer cuts introduce mixed literals.
		  These are literals containing local symbols from both input
		  formulae. In this paper, we present a scheme to compute
		  Craig interpolants in the presence of mixed literals.
		  Contrary to existing approaches, this scheme neither limits
		  the inferences done by the SMT solver, nor does it
		  transform the proof tree before extracting interpolants.
		  Our scheme works for the combination of uninterpreted
		  functions and linear arithmetic but should also be
		  extendable to other theories. The scheme is implemented in
		  the interpolating SMT solver SMTInterpol.},
