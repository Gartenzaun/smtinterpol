    In this paper, we explore the potential of the theory of nested words for partial correctness proofs of recursive programs.  Our conceptual contribution is a simple framework that allows us to shine a new light on classical concepts such as Floyd/Hoare proofs and predicate abstraction in the context of recursive programs.  Our technical contribution is an interpolant-based software model checking method for recursive programs.   The method avoids the costly construction of the abstract transformer by constructing a nested word automaton from an inductive sequence of `nested interpolants' (i.e., interpolants for a nested word which represents an infeasible error trace).
